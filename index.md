### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    I enjoyed lab four because of the usefulness of the program. When I
    enter an amount in milliliters, it gives me the conversion in teaspoons,
    tablespoons, ounces, and cups. In this lab I learned how to implement
    separate functions for each unit conversion. 

* Lab 7
    Lab seven was one of my favorites because I found that the program
    about parking permission based on street, day, and time to be very
    engaging. I learned the importance of input validation for street
    names, days, hours, and minutes. I also learned how crucial it is
    to be precise when creating the 'if' statements for determining
    parking times.

* Lab 11
    I liked lab eleven because I was able to make a guessing game. It was
    fun to be able to use a random number generator and see what practical 
    uses they have. I also enjoyed making precise 'if' statements to
    accurately test to see if the user guessed the right number.
